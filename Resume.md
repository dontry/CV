##Research Experience
#### Eye-tracking study based on image aesthetics assessment 2011.12-2012.5
>Perform an eye-tracking experiment to explore which kind of features effects on the aesthetic appealing of images across different category. It involves digital image processing, image aesthetics and computer vision.
#### Salient regions detection 2012.9-2013.7
>Detect the salient regions in an image consistent with human visual perception by analyzing segmented regions’ homogeneity and disparity in color and position. It involves computer vision, pattern recognition and image processing.  The paper “Saliency detection based on region descriptors and prior knowledge ” was published on Signal Processing: Image Communication.
####On-device Image aesthetics assessment 2013.4-2014.2
>Develop an image aesthetics assessment application on Android mobile system. This application can perform real-time assessment for photographs. It involves image aesthetics, machine learning and Android application development. The paper “Synthesized Computational Aesthetic Evaluation of Photos” is accepted by Neurocomputing.  
#####Computational Image Aesthetic Evaluation and Optimizing Composition 2013.5-2014.6
>Study on omputational image aeshetics evaluation and optimizing image composition. The contributions includes develop an innovative saliency detection algorithm, design a integrated image aesthetic evaluation model using machine learning method, propose an optimizing compositon algorithm based on image retargeting techniques. The dissertation was honored as “Excellent dissertation in 2014”.
